## Overview

New York City CitiBike data was used to perform an analysis that will help investors looking to begin a bikesharing program in De Moises, Iowa. 
While De Moises is far away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis will help the investors with some of the key components for a 
successful program.

-	Who uses bikeshare programs?
-	What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
-	What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
-	How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results

As we can see on the dash below there were 2,344,224 trips during the month of August from which the 1,900,359 are subscribers and 443,865 
short term customers.  There is a high potential if the rideshare program gest promoted for annual subscriptions.

##Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare is unusually popular in busy metropolitan areas, where traffic is densely packed and parking spaces are limited. 
The male population could be the head of attention providing the program regular income, however more outreaches should be done to 
attract female riders. 

Additional lines of inquiry for analysis could be:

- Display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours.
- Merge De Moises city data, gender population, traffic peak hours, parking spaces in metropolitan area and compare with NY.
